	<h1>This is not particularly edifying</h1>
	<p>I did medicine out of fear that I wouldn't be good enough at any one thing to be useful. After a year or two at Glasgow 
  I decided that I was destined for academic medicine and did an intercalated BSc, following some questionable advice. It was 
  good fun and gave me contacts and a start that I maybe wouldn't have had otherwise. On the other hand it was not terribly 
  directed and I spread myself too thinly to produce very much. </p>
  <p>A house job at the Western surrounded me with talented, 
  messed up, sad and inspiring doctors and convinced me that I had to get the hell out of there and try again to find the mix 
  of science and poetry that they almost captured, with perhaps less alcohol and not as much cynicism. Perhaps fortunately I was saved 
  from my first impulse to go right back on that resolution as I knocked myself unconscious snowboarding a day before my interview 
  for the Western and was canned from the lineup. They did nepotise me a job at the Southern, which was a good use for someone of 
  my skills, educability and flexible moral compass and taught me both good medicine and good intuition.</p>
  <p>As it turns out,
  medicine is quite a good place not to be good at any one thing and I'm pleased with my skillset and how I manage my patients. 
  My sister was diagnosed with a rare cancer in that time and while I numbly failed my MRCP she died ten months later, essentially 
  unaided by me or by the toxic mess of standard therapy. For that reason I wouldn't call the Southern a good time, particularly, but 
  nor would I blame it for ruining my best relationships with the best of people leaving me a broken option, 
  a modern Ronin. So we can call it quits.</p>
  <p>After the consultants of the Southern gratefully watched me slide out of view I did odd jobs about the country and regained 
  some peace without touching the core of whatever was at the core. Haematology in Chichester, Medicine in Dumfries, the rounds of 
  such Ronin, were gentle and seductive and gave me enough peace at least to pass my MRCP. Then I debunked to Australia to lose my 
  moorings properly.
  </p>
  <p>Australia is the sort of place you can lose your moorings but it takes a surprising amount of work. For a start, the kind of 
  person who loses their moorings here is pretty messed up. Lives in a barrel, that sort of level. Everyone else is rigidly policed 
  by societal norms and a social class system inherited from the 1950s and adapted only on the very surface. So instead I found 
  Intensive Care, as it seems I was always meant to, and a supportive and lovely eccentricity in St Vincent's. I was just about ready 
  to come back to Scotland and restart myself after 5 years at that point, so I came to Darwin to lead a monkish existence on my way 
  home. It's very hard to see any of these big ruptures as anything other than well handled mistakes, in retrospect. My first 
  consultant job was here in 2009 and then I went to Edinburgh to restart my time as a Respiratory registrar, with dreams of a portfolio 
  sort of job doing 0.3 chest, 0.3 ICU and 0.4 some sort of academic pursuity.</p>
  <p>So then <emph>I</emph> got cancer. I was certain that it was something rare and protean like my sister's, so I said my goodbyes 
  internally and made ready to face the end.  I still wasn't really believing it was over when I packed up again after 18 months and 
  came back to a very well paid consultant job in Darwin, so that at least my promises could be kept and I wouldn't leave anyone 
  poor.</p>

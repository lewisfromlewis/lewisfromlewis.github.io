## How not to kill people with ventilators
The first few times you encounter a ventilator it's because somebody else has started it.

How do you use it safely and get through the first few shifts without being an expert, *and yet* not 
doing any avoidable damage to the most vulnerable patients in the hospital?

## Safe ventilation
- Tidal volume 6 ml/kg ideal body weight
- Peak pressure 35 cmH2O or lower
- PEEP for everyone, no ZEEP
- No staircase recruitment
- No oscillator in ARDS
- 

## Why would you get into this anyway?
Indications, evidence and practice

## General principles
Physiology, medicine, uncertainty and compassion

## Special circumstances
ARDS, emphysema, asthma, pneumonia, Bronchopleural fistula

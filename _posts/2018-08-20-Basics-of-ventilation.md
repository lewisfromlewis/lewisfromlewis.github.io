# How not to kill people with ventilators
The first few times you encounter a ventilator it's because somebody else has started it.

How do you use it safely and get through the first few shifts without being an expert, *and yet* not 
doing any avoidable damage to the most vulnerable patients in the hospital?

## Basic questions
- What organ failures are treated with a ventilator?
- How do you recognise them?
- How do you grade their severity?
- What are the usual ventilator settings?

## Lung Safe Ventilation
- Tidal volume 6 ml/kg ideal body weight
>- therefore tolerate <55mmHg PaCO2
- Peak pressure 35 cmH2O or lower
- PEEP for everyone, no ZEEP
- Sedation titrated to the patient
- No staircase recruitment
- No oscillator in ARDS
- Think of overinflation, gas trapping, collapse and atelectrauma

## How not to kill people with ventilators
Don't use them unless they're needed.  Duh.
- Don't view it as an end in itself
- Always project:
- Recognise your fear and listen to it

# Why would you get into this anyway?
Indications, evidence and practice
- It is a solution, not a problem, a state or a result
- It's a physiologically justified intervention
- There are some safety tips

## Expert questions
- How do assess the relative contribution of organ system failures?
- How do you balance the treatment needs of each?
- What pathological pathways result in respiratory failure?
- How do you diagnose the aetiology?
- When do you need a CT scan?
- When do you need tissue?
- How do you predict outcome?

# General principles
Physiology, medicine, uncertainty and compassion

# Special circumstances
ARDS, emphysema, asthma, pneumonia, Bronchopleural fistula

## ARDS
ARDS is a condition dear to the heart of Intensive Care Medicine

- We saw it first, we caused most of it and now we treat it all
- The first trials of pragmatic "housekeeping" were in ARDS
- We have improved outcomes

## ARDS
Berlin definition

- PaO2:FiO2 ratio <300mmHg despite PEEP 5 cmH2O or more
- Within 1 week of a known insult
- Bilateral opacities
- Not fully explained by effusions, collapse or nodules
- Not fully explained by fluid overload or cardiac failure
- P:F <300 mild, <200 moderate, <100 severe

## ARDS
The pathway to treating ARDS well represents science used for clinical
practice. There are few better examples of responsible academic medicine.
Sadly this is because it was a military condition largely affecting well-off
populations.

## ARDS
- Diffuse condition, affecting only some parts of the lung
- Initiated by inflammation
>- yes, I know that's not very specific

## ARDS
- Explain the contributors to the gradient in oxygen tension between inhaled gas and mitochondria?  Where are these altered in ARDS?
- What are the airflow abnormalities in ARDS? How are lung volumes altered?
- How is airway resistance defined and how is it altered in ARDS?  How is it measured?
- What is compliance?  When is it measured?  How is it changed in ARDS?
- What is the relevance of the Bohr equation to ARDS?


## Emphysema
- A condition of high compliance and high resistance
>- Which means low elastance and low conductance

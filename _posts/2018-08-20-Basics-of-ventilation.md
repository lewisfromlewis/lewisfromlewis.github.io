4. Special circumstances

## How not to kill people with ventilators
The first few times you encounter a ventilator it's because somebody else has started it.

How do you use it safely and get through the first few shifts without being an expert, *and yet* not 
doing any avoidable damage to the most vulnerable patients in the hospital?

## Lung Safe Ventilation
- Tidal volume 6 ml/kg ideal body weight
>- therefore tolerate <55mmHg PaCO2
- Peak pressure 35 cmH2O or lower
- PEEP for everyone, no ZEEP
- No staircase recruitment
- No oscillator in ARDS
- Think of overinflation, gas trapping, collapse and atelectrauma

## Why would you get into this anyway?
Indications, evidence and practice

## General principles
Physiology, medicine, uncertainty and compassion

## Special circumstances
ARDS, emphysema, asthma, pneumonia, Bronchopleural fistula

## ARDS
ARDS is a condition dear to the heart of Intensive Care Medicine

- We saw it first, we caused most of it and now we treat it all
- The first trials of pragmatic "housekeeping" were in ARDS
- We have improved outcomes

## ARDS
Berlin definition

- PaO2:FiO2 ratio <300mmHg despite PEEP 5 cmH2O or more
- Within 1 week of a known insult
- Bilateral opacities
- Not fully explained by effusions, collapse or nodules
- Not fully explained by fluid overload or cardiac failure
- P:F <300 mild, <200 moderate, <100 severe

## ARDS
The pathway to treating ARDS well represents science used for clinical
practice. There are few better examples of responsible academic medicine.
Sadly this is because it was a military condition largely affecting well-off
populations.

## ARDS
- Diffuse condition, affecting only some parts of the lung
- Initiated by inflammation
>- yes, I know that's not very specific
- 

## ARDS



## Emphysema
- A condition of high compliance and high resistance
>- Which means low elastance and low conductance
